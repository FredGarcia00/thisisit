# Git Setup Complete! 

Git has been installed and your project is now ready for GitHub.

## Next Steps:

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Create a new repository (name it something like `viral-reel-studio`)
3. Don't initialize with README (we already have files)
4. Copy the repository URL

### 2. Connect to GitHub
Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPO_NAME` with your actual GitHub details:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Deploy to Vercel
```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel login
vercel
```

## If you get authentication errors:
- Use a Personal Access Token instead of password
- Or set up SSH keys in GitHub settings

## Your project is now ready for deployment! ðŸš€

All files have been optimized and git is properly configured.
